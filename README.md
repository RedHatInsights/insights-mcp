# Image Builder MCP

This repo is in a DRAFT and playground state!

An MCP server to interact with [hosted image builder](https://osbuild.org/docs/hosted/architecture/)

## Authentication

Go to https://console.redhat.com to `'YOUR USER' ➡ My User Access ➡ Service Accounts` create a service account
and then set the environment variables `IMAGE_BUILDER_CLIENT_ID` and `IMAGE_BUILDER_CLIENT_SECRET` accordingly.

## Run
Just install the requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and run

```
python image-builder-mcp.py --sse
```

This will start image-builder-mcp server at http://localhost:9000/sse

or you can integrate e.g. into vscode without arguments (defaulting to `stdio` transport)

example configuration here could look like this:

```
{
    "inputs": [
        {
            "id": "image_builder_client_id",
            "type": "promptString",
            "description": "Enter the Image Builder Client ID",
            "default": ""
        },
        {
            "id": "image_builder_client_secret",
            "type": "promptString",
            "description": "Enter the Image Builder Client Secret",
            "default": ""
        }
    ],
    "servers": {
        "image-builder-mcp-stdio": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "bash",
            "args": [
                "-c",
                "cd FOLDER_OF_YOUR_GIT_CLONES/image-builder-mcp ; python image-builder-mcp.py"
            ],
            "env": {
                "IMAGE_BUILDER_CLIENT_ID": "${input:image_builder_client_id}",
                "IMAGE_BUILDER_CLIENT_SECRET": "${input:image_builder_client_secret}"
            }
        }
    }
}
