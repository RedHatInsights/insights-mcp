## Pipelines as Code configuration
To start the PipelineRun, add a new comment in a pull-request with content `/ok-to-test`

For more detailed information about running a PipelineRun, please refer to Pipelines as Code documentation [Running the PipelineRun](https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/running/)

To customize the proposed PipelineRuns after merge, please refer to [Build Pipeline customization](https://konflux-ci.dev/docs/how-tos/configuring/)

Please follow the block sequence indentation style introduced by the proposed PipelineRuns YAMLs, or keep using consistent indentation level through your customized PipelineRuns. When different levels are mixed, it will be changed to the proposed style.
