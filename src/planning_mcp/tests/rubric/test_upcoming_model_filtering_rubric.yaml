        The assistant's response should:
        1. Understand the user's intent to list all package removals from RHEL 9.2 to RHEL 10
        2. Provide a helpful and informative summary of the package removals
        3. Not return raw JSON as the sole content - the response should be human-readable
        4. Include relevant context about the package removals
        5. Include general advice about updating to RHEL 10
