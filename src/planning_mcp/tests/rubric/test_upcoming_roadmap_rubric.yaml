        The assistant's response should:
        1. Understand the user's intent to learn about RHEL 10 upcoming changes
        2. Provide a helpful and informative summary of the changes
        3. Not return raw JSON as the sole content - the response should be human-readable
        4. Include relevant context about deprecations, additions, or enhancements
